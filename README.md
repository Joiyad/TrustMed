+ The supply chain has been using RFID (Radio Frequency IDentification) technology for anti-counterfeiting measures for more than a decade.

### Why blockchain? <a name="why_blockchain"></a>
+ Immutability in decentralized systems ensures that transaction records and product information cannot be tampered with, strengthening the fight against counterfeiting.
+ Blockchain's decentralization fosters trust and collaboration among stakeholders, enabling direct verification and peer-to-peer interactions that contribute to the prevention and detection of counterfeit products.
+ Blockchain's transparency empowers consumers and stakeholders to verify product authenticity by providing an open and auditable record of transactions, thereby bolstering efforts to combat counterfeiting.
+ Blockchain's traceability feature enables the transparent tracking of product movements, making it a powerful tool in combating counterfeiting by verifying the authenticity and origin of goods throughout the supply chain.
